# AzureStorageFromAngular

This project provides examples to manage the Azure Storage from Angular.

## How to work

In the Azure Storage CORS section, add right CORS in order to access the resources externally.
In the Azure Storage Shared access signature SAS section, give also permissions to Service, Container and Object. After that generate a new SAS.
